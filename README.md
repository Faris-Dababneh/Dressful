DRESSFUL!
Dressful is a tool that creates outfits for users according to their physical attributes, desired occasion, and style. On the outfit creation screen, the user has a sidebar containing every input field and a preview section that shows the current outfit. Once an outfit request is made, a custom-written prompt with the user input is fed to GPT-3.5. The return text is interpreted to find each clothing item within Amazon's best sellers list, which is then laid out for the user.

Created in React.js using TailwindCSS, Firebase, OpenAI's API, and OpenWeb Ninja's Amazon Data API (https://rapidapi.com/user/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5).

Garnered 200+ users and thousands of page visits over 2024.
